WEB SERVERS
NGINIX
Reverse proxy - Forwards requests to client's backend app or web serers.
Load balancing - Distributes traffic or requests to other serers for scalability

DNS
IP/TCP - Underlying communuication that keeps the IP address of the client
INTERNET
HTTP
FILE - cODE FILES(CSS, JS, HTML) AND Assets(Multimedia and stuff like that)

DNS - The domain name system is a server system that stores the Ip addresses
alongside their respectie website names. 

Packets - Small chunks ofv data tfiles pofv a website sentv in order, afvterv 
a client rvequestvs a webpage. it is sent in smalls so that multiple clients can rveceie
responses silmultanousely.in case of data corruption during transit,that little chunk can be fixed.
Order of files parsing - HTML, link of CSS and then JS or PHP

NB: A successful HTTP request and response returns '200 OK' and '404 Not Found' and '301 Moed permanently' for moed files
HTTP is a stateless protocol, which means that each request from a client to a server is independent and doesn't retain any information about previous requests. This is why mechanisms like cookies and sessions are used to maintain stateful interactions in web applications.

What are the main HTTP requests


 TTL (Time to Live) in DNS is a setting that specifies how long DNS resolver and caching servers should store and use cached DNS records before refreshing them by querying authoritative DNS servers. It plays a crucial role in balancing DNS performance and accuracy.
So its like an expiry time is gien to thw cached data pulled from a DNS serer, based on the clients reques. When the time elapsis, the DNS would hae to enter into its system and pull the information or data on that particular web adress in an updated form.
