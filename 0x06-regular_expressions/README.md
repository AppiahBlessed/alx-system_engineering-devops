Project Title
Description
This project showcases a regular expression that matches strings adhering to the pattern:

ruby
Copy code
^h.n$
The regular expression looks for strings that start with the letter 'h', followed by any single character, and end with the letter 'n'.

Usage
To use this regular expression, you can incorporate it into your programming code or utilize it in any regex tool. When you apply this regex to a string, it will determine if the string follows the specified pattern.

Examples
The string "hello" matches the pattern, as it starts with 'h', has one character ('e') in between, and ends with 'n'.
The string "hun" also matches the pattern, with 'u' as the single character in between.
However, the string "hon" does not match the pattern, as it doesn't satisfy the conditions.
