README FOR SFTP PROCESS
The tasks required us to complete 27 challenges in all, divided in three parts.
The screenshots of the completed task are found in the command_line_for_the_win
directory. We were then asked to connect our sandbox to our local machine using
SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) and use the sftp command 'put' to load 
the jpg and png frmats of our completed tasks.

Below are the steps I followed in linking my snadbox to my local machine

1. I changed my cuurent directory to the directory containing the screenshots.
2. I then copied the sftp link from the sandbox(ALX Intranet).
3. Entered the link into my local terminal.
4. A password was enquired so i copied that too from the sandbox menu.
5. I then used the put sftp method with a wild card to copy all the 
image files into /root/alx-system_engineering-devops/command_line_for_the_win/
6. After confirming on the sandbox that the files have reflected, i used 'exit'
to end the process
